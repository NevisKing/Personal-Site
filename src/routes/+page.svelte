<h1>Nevis' personal site</h1>

<p>This is where I'll eventually host whatever information or app examples I want to make public.
    For now I'm messing around with SvelteKit to understand its ins and outs. If you want to see that
    heres a 

<a href = "/hello-world">link</a>
    and here's my 
    <a href="/blog">blog</a>
</p>


<style>
    p {
        font-family: "Comic-Sans MS";
        width: 50%;
        margin: auto;
        text-align: center;
    }
    h1 {
        margin: auto;
        width: 50%;
        text-align: center;
    }
</style>
