		<h2>2022-12-19</h2>
		<p>Today I wrote up this website with SvelteKit! I created the landing page and messed around 
            a bit on the hello world page. Then I made this part of the site to record any thoughts I have
            while building the site, or maybe as a place to share any writings I feel like putting down.
             The website is built using SvelteKit and hosted with Vercel.
